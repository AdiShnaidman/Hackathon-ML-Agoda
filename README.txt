# Agoda Hotel Cancellations Hackathon Challenge

I participated in the Agoda Hackathon Challenge, concentrating on Hotel Cancellationsâ€”a data-driven competition that required leveraging machine learning to predict and optimize hotel booking cancellations.

On this note, I'd like to express my gratitude to my colleagues Shoham Mazuz, Omer Ventura, and Amit Benbenishti for their outstanding collaborative efforts on this project.
